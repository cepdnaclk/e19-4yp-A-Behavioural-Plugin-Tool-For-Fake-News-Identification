# A Behavioural Plugin Tool for Fake News Identification 
___

## Abstract
The rapid spread of fake news on digital platforms poses significant risks, 
influencing public opinion and undermining trust in media. This proposal aims 
to enhance the accuracy of fake news detection by developing a multimodal 
system that integrates both text and image analysis. Recognizing that fake news 
often relies on misleading content in both formats, the project will explore 
various machine learning and deep learning models, incorporating advanced 
natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and emotional 
cues, as well as computer vision models for image classification. Additionally, 
user behaviour, such as likes, shares, and comments, will be analyzed to capture 
social network dynamics. The most effective model will be selected through 
performance evaluation and integrated into a browser plugin. This tool will 
provide users with a seamless, real-time interface for detecting fake news while 
browsing the web. The outcome will be an accurate, user-friendly, and efficient 
browser plugin that enhances content trustworthiness through advanced fake 
news detection.
